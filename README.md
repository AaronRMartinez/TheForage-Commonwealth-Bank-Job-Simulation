## Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Cybersecurity

I completed a job simulation focused on the role of a cybersecurity generalist specializing in fraud detection and prevention for Commonwealth Bank's Cybersecurity team. Through this job simulation, I developed skills in building data visualization dashboards using Splunk to uncover patterns and insights in historical customer data. Which aided in the detection of potential fraud. I also demonstrated the ability to respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents. Actions including notifying relevant teams, collecting critical information, containing and stopping attacks, and assisting in recovery efforts. Additionally, I enhanced my security awareness expertise by designing infographics promoting best practices for secure password management, following Australian Cybersecurity Center guidelines. I also gained practical experience in penetration testing, assessing web application security, identifying vulnerabilities, and providing recommendations to strengthen cybersecurity defenses.
